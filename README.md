# Overview

The project was created to familiarize myself with firebase functionality. It will be a small blogging platform.

The scaffolding of the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project was created with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Functionality

- Anon users can only read posts
- Form to create a user
- Oauth to sign in
- User needs to log in to do CRUD operations on their own posts and vote on others' posts
- User should be able to see all their posts

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
